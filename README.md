Ionic Sonic
----------------

This project is just intended to be a playground to test out some idea regarding the web audio api. It's not intended to
be a product of any kind.

I'm just throwing paint at the wall here and doing it publicly on github :-)

I want to explore:

1. different ways of going between audio and visual representations of audio.
2. how to write code against the web audio api and canvas that integrate cleanly with react/redux
3. recent changes to the web audio api such as web audio workers
4. was to package and distribute ionic applications for desktop devices
5. performance on latest raspberry pi with touch

## Dependencies

1. ionic cli

`npm install -g ionic`

## Running

`ionic serve`
